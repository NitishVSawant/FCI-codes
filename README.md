# Food Corporation of India (FCI) Project

Machine Learning models for decision making in food grain transportation planning undertaken by Food Corporation of India (FCI)

Classification Models to predict whether the demurrage cost will incur or not using various supervised machine learning algorithms. Classification Models developed for two warehouses namely Kazhakuttam and Chingavanam in Kerala region

Regression Models to predict the demurrage hours using various supervised machine learning algorithms. Regression Models developed for five warehouses namely Kazhakuttam, Chingavanam, Karunagappally, Kollam and Mavelikkara in Kerala region
